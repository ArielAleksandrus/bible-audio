# bible-audio

Hear the Bible in your car, in an airplane, in your trips.
We often lose Internet connection, but now THAT WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM.
This app allows you to:

  - **Download** the audio files for offline hearing
  - **Keep up** with a preloaded reading plan
  
Currently, the only version that I have added is **PORTUGUESE (ARA)**.

So, the next improvements should be:

  - [ ] :hourglass_flowing_sand: **Support for other languages and Bible versions**
  - [ ] :hourglass_flowing_sand: Support for more reading plans and custom plans
  - [ ] :hourglass_flowing_sand: Showing the Bible text as well. (only audio supported for now)

## Motivation: 

I used to love Youversion's Bible app. Unfortunately, not sure if it was due to a specific update, lately it is IMPOSSIBLE to hear the Bible in my car because it needs an Internet connection and I like to hear it in my car. Often I lose internet connection and the app bugs.
Turns out they DO NOT offer offline Bible audio and they don't intend to! So, here's my alternative!

## IMPLEMENTATION

I'm using the following frameworks:

  - Ionic v7.1.1
  - Capacitor v5.0.4
  - Angular v16.0.0

Special thanks to some Github users whose plugins/libs helped me a lot:

  - @daubit in https://github.com/daubit/capacitor-media-session
  - @jofr in https://github.com/jofr/capacitor-media-session
